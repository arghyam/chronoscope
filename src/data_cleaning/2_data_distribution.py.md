## 1. Introduction

This document details the Python script used to analyze the distribution of annotations within a CSV file named `annotations.csv`. The script leverages the `pandas` library for efficient data manipulation and the `collections.Counter` object for convenient frequency counting.  The primary goal is to determine the frequency and percentage of each unique annotation present in the dataset.


## 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing

The script begins by importing necessary libraries: `collections.Counter` for counting occurrences of items and `pandas` as `pd` for data manipulation.

```python
from collections import Counter
import pandas as pd
```

The `pandas` library's `read_csv()` function is then used to load the annotation data from the file located at `'data/data_suman/annotations.csv'`. This function reads the CSV file and creates a pandas DataFrame, which is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.  The DataFrame is stored in the variable `df`.

```python
# Read the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('data/data_suman/annotations.csv')
```

No explicit data preprocessing steps are performed beyond loading the CSV.  It is assumed the CSV is correctly formatted with a column named 'annotation' containing the annotation labels.


## 3. Annotation Distribution Calculation

The core logic of the script lies in calculating the distribution of annotations. This is achieved in two steps:

1. **Counting Annotations:** The line `distribution = df['annotation'].value_counts()` utilizes the pandas `value_counts()` method. This method efficiently counts the occurrences of each unique value in the specified column ('annotation' in this case). The result, a pandas Series where the index represents the unique annotations and the values represent their counts, is stored in the `distribution` variable.

2. **No explicit algorithm is used beyond the pandas `value_counts()` function.  The function itself employs optimized internal algorithms for efficient counting.**

```python
# Get the distribution
distribution = df['annotation'].value_counts()
```

## 4. Output

Finally, the script iterates through the `distribution` Series and prints the annotation, its count, and its percentage relative to the total number of annotations.

The output is formatted as follows:

| Annotation | Count | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| Annotation 1 |  Count of Annotation 1 | Percentage of Annotation 1 |
| Annotation 2 |  Count of Annotation 2 | Percentage of Annotation 2 |
| ... | ... | ... |


The loop uses an f-string for concise formatting:

```python
print("Distribution of annotations:")
for annotation, count in distribution.items():
    print(f"{annotation}: {count} ({(count/len(df)*100):.1f}%)")
```

This provides a clear and easily understandable summary of the annotation distribution within the dataset.
